<title>Challenge 10</title>
<body>I hope you've been keeping track of all of your answers. They aren't just some random letters. They are actually a base-64 encoded message. Here's how you read it: assemble the directory names for each challenge into one long string. Slap an "=" on the end of it and it can be decoded. Only include the directory names that start each challenge (i.e, don't include the cabinets, part number, etc).
