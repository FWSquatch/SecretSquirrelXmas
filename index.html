<p>Congratulations! You've made it into the game. You are now a member of the Secret Squirrel Society (SSS). As a member there are some rules you must follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just like Fight Club, the first rule of SSS is WE DO NOT TALK ABOUT SSS. Don't tell your neighbor and don't tell Mr Davis. He's proud of you for getting this far, but he will not acknowledge your achievement. You are going it ALONE. All of the challenges you complete must be done BY YOURSELF.</li>
<li>Do not use automated tools against the Squirrel Server unless instructed to do so. Mr Davis has taken some precautions against scanning tools, but you never can tell, so please don't break the Squirrel Server by accident.</li>
<li>You will be presented with challenges. Some will be easy, some will not. There is no scoreboard. The challenges have to be completed in order so that you may make it to the final goal. If you complete the final challenge, it will be obvious to everyone in the room.</li>
<li>Challenges are located in folders on this web server. I know what you're thinking, "I'll just dirb this server and find them all!" Don't bother, here's the first location: <a href="WW91IGhhdmUgbWFkZS">172.16.122.215/WW91IGhhdmUgbWFkZS</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
