<h1>You MADE IT!!</h1></br>
On to the final challenge!</br></br>You may have noticed that Santa's Christmas Tree has a star at the top of it but it doesn't light up. You are going to fix that.</br> I've given you some items along the way. Now it's time to use them. Here is the purpose of each item:
</br>
Item1: username</br>
Item2: password</br>
Item3: port number</br>
Item4: Raspberry Pi wiring diagram</br>
Item5: Sample code</br></br>
Use these items to remote into the Raspberry Pi controlling this circus and make the star on Santa's tree blink yellow.
