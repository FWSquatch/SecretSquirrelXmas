Santa has a server that receives Christmas lists from good boys and girls. He has been wanting to upgrade it, but he needs to know what day of the year would be the best to do it. Rumor has it, there was a day last year where the server only handled ONE event all day! Take a look at this <a href="santa.log">logfile</a> and find the day of the year that has the LEAST number of events being logged. When you have found that day, you will find what you seek in the folder named "NameOfWisher_2017-XX-XX". For example if it is Bob on July 4th, then the folder would be named Bob_2017_07_04.
